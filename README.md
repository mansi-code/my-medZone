#The problem MedZone solves
Problem 1
Most of the patients frequently have difficulty in remembering or managing multiple medications .Many a times they forget medicine name and how they look like, especially for elders. Medication non-adherence leads to 125,000 preventable deaths each year, and about $300 billion in avoidable healthcare costs.

Problem 2
We all have multiple folders in back of our closets full of medical records, prescriptions , test reports etc. which lets all agree are a hassle to carry everytime a doctor asks for our medical history .

Problem 3
In times of emergency every minute counts and in that minute finding contacts of our caregivers, nearby hospitals, pharmacies and doctors is extremely difficult.

#Challenges we ran into
CRUD operations in firebase took a lot more of our time than expected but together we overcame this. Pushing image notifications was another obstacle but with constant hardwork and support we finally completed it .
With the help of our mentors and youtube research we worked all night. Handling this project with college classes was a test of our time management and required us to giveup our sleep schedule.

#Technologies we used
Firebase SQLite Flutter
